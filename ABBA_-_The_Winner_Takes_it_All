I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The Gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
(Takes it all)
The loser has to fall
(Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain
(Yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide
(Decide)
The likes of me abide
(Abide)
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
(Staying low)
The game is on again
(All again)
A lover or a friend
(Or a friend)
A big thing or a small
(Big or small)
The winner takes it all
(Takes it all)
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
Someone winner
Takes it all
And one loses
Has to fall
From a guide
From the side
Makes that feeling
Someone here
Takes it all
Has to fall
This is magic
Someone here
